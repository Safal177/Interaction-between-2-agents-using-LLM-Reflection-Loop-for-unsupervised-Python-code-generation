These small sublists are then merged back together in sorted order.\\n\\n2. **`merge` Function**: Takes two sorted lists (left and right) and merges them into a single sorted list. This function efficiently combines them by comparing the smallest unmerged elements of each list until all elements are merged.\\n\\n3. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when the list being sorted has one or no elements since a list with one or zero elements is inherently sorted.\\n\\n4. **Example Usage**: The script also includes an example to demonstrate sorting a sample array using the `merge_sort` function.\\n\\nWith these comments and structured approach, you should get a clear understanding of how the Merge Sort algorithm works using this code.'}]"

These small sublists are then merged back together in sorted order.\\n\\n2. **`merge` Function**: Takes two sorted lists (left and right) and merges them into a single sorted list. This function efficiently combines them by comparing the smallest unmerged elements of each list until all elements are merged.\\n\\n3. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when the list being sorted has one or no elements since a list with one or zero elements is inherently sorted.\\n\\n4. **Example Usage**: The script also includes an example to demonstrate sorting a sample array using the `merge_sort` function.\\n\\nWith these comments and structured approach, you should get a clear understanding of how the Merge Sort algorithm works using this code.'},\n",
