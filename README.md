# Interaction-between-2-agents-using-LLM-Reflection-Loop-for-unsupervised-Python-code-generation

# Project label:
Investigating two Agents communication through an LLM centered on Reflection Loop for self-operating Python programming.

# AI Agent and LLM frameworks:
•	Coding language: Python,
•	OpenAI: LLM (gpt-4o) 
•	Google Colab
•	Prompt maximization
•	Reflection loops
•	Python Machine Learning
•	Natural Language Processing (NLP)

# Project overview:
The major concern of this project is making a reliable agentic AI pipeline which automatically writes, analyzes, and fine-tunes Python code using a large language model (LLM). Python code passes through repetitive reflection iterations. The workflow has two agents:  code generation agent rooted in user prompts, and feedback agent who functions as a specialist such as Andrej Karpathy. The feedback agent analyzes and then corrects code. At the end, this agent provides guidance to generation agent. This method adopts strategies from autonomous learning through feedback, prompt tuning, and agent-based cooperation to allow autonomous and accurate code. The code is self-refining. 

# Project target: 
The main goal of this project is to make a self-refining AI programmer. It has some steps:
•	Make Python programs according to user’s prompt. 
•	Show better code from evaluation and refinement cycles 
•	Keep logical message sequences with memory management
•	Show self-correcting code pipelines 

# Notable features:
•	Google Colab support: Every block of code executes without external control. 
•	Loop between generation and reflection phases: Two agents can understand each other for getting clean code. 
•	Structured chat memory: Limit message to get better LLM efficiency. 
•	Agent role instructions: Give clear prompts to system 
•	Self-refining Code: 
•	Every loop upgrades the code produced from the generation phase.
•	Flexible and scalable framework: Easy to make model, configure data analysis as well as NLP work. 

# Final thoughts:
I illustrate that LLMs are working as self-operating agents for creating code and refining it without my help. The model generates self-refined code. The LLM reflection pattern forms a basic structure for making Agentic AI systems with decision-making capabilities and automating end-to-end data analysis pipelines. Overall, I can show my skill in applying Python programming, NLP, prompt programming, and LLM for making reflective agentic AI systems with necessary skills for developing reusable Agentic AI systems.
